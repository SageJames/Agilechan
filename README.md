## Introduction

The agile mindset was created by developers to welcome change and overcome difficulty. For all people that have or want to be a part of a modern development team, it is essential to learn the agile mindset and its frameworks. That is why Agilechan was invented. Its job is to support you while keeping track of your daily agile processes and reminding you about the principles of agile from your terminal! Currently, Agilechan provides support for Scrum, XP, and Kanban. [Website formant](https://sagejames.github.io/Agilechan/)

## FAQs

- How will this help me?
	- Agilechan will keep you on track with your daily activities for whatever agile framework you use. For example, if you are in your daily sprint and need some guidance, you can call Agilechan and it will provide you with the three tasks you need to complete:
		+ It will show you what you did the last time you used Agilechan. 
		+ Make you write down what you are going to do today. 
		+ And ask you to write down the obstacles in your way.    
- When should I use it?
	- We recommended that you use Agilechan daily, for the best results. But it is ok to use it every blue moon in a sprint cycle (4-5 times).
- Why did you create this?
	- I wanted something that could better my implementation of an agile mindset and does not require a team.
- What if I want to have another agile framework?
	- Make a pull request and let everyone know what framework you want to implement.
- What will this do for my team?
	- Hopefully it will give them some physical overview of how they performed during a sprint cycle and also enhance the reflection phase.
- Do I really need a team?
	- No. You can use Agilechan to practice the agile mindset alone as a standalone developer.
